# SNAPCHAT
It's a group project, we had to do a mobile application with React Native, like a clone of Snapchat. 

In your terminal : you can go in "snapchat" dir, and run 
```npm start```

Automatically, the app will launch with expo. You can flash the QR code and enjoy the app on the application "expo", on your phone ! 
You can also run the app in the browser but.. be careful! It will be ugly!!
